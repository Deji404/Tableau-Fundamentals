# Tableau-Fundamentals

## Tools Used: Tableau

## Description
This is part of the requirements for completion of the Tableau Fundamentals course, which I took as part of the Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (BIDA) certification offered by the Corporate Finance Institute in conjunction with alX.

In this course, we were required to create two dashboards from a csv file containing sales data from a time period. The content covered data cleaning and transformation (all done in Tableau), basic and Level of Detail calculations, filters, slicers and their application levels, and dashboard design.

The results are provided in the general Tableau workbook as well as in a PDF file.
